            Love is in the air, but so is opportunity—especially in Ottawa’s real estate market! While winter usually
            slows things down, this season is proving that determined buyers and motivated sellers don’t hit pause just
            because there’s snow on the ground. Homes are selling fast, interest rate chatter is heating up, and all
            eyes are on what’s next for the market.
            <br><br>
            Beyond real estate, this month is about celebration and reflection. Black History Month gives us a chance to
            honour the incredible contributions of Black Canadians, and Ottawa is hosting some inspiring events you
            won’t want to miss. Let’s get into it!

            Bank of Canada Cuts Rates – What It Means for You

        </h3>

        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p data-aos="fade-up" class="text-zinc-600 mt-5 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            On January 29, 2025, the Bank of Canada lowered its key interest rate to 3%, making borrowing more
            affordable. This marks a major shift from the high rates of 2023-24, when mortgage costs were significantly
            higher.

        </h3>

        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p data-aos="fade-up" class="text-zinc-600 mt-5 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Overnight rate (affects mortgage rates): 3% <br><br>
            Bank Rate (what banks pay to borrow money): 3.25% <br><br>
            Deposit Rate (what banks earn on deposits): 2.95% <br><br>
            Even more interesting? The Bank is ending quantitative tightening (measures to slow inflation) and will
            restart asset purchases in March. If inflation remains under control, we could see even lower borrowing
            costs later this year.

            With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepping down, Canada is entering a leadership transition ahead of the
            next federal election on October 20, 2025. The Liberal Party will select a new leader, and as the election

            You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don’t make money your goal. Instead, pursue
            the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off of you.
